# cryptomass

## Intro
I am not a coder. I am only interested in opensource and decentralised projects and would like to become more active in the community. In fact, after many years perusing Github repositories, this is my first. 

As most people are enabled and/or motivated by money, I believe a logical way to introduce people to collaboration and decentralisation is through trading crypocurrency. There is potentially some money to be made through trading crypto, but it requires research and active monitoring to increase the chances of making profit.

My background is media production. Through this project we can gain and share a better understanding of the cryptocurrencey space, and how we it can be utilised to develop community assets and resources. 

### This is not a professionally coded project
I'm putting this on Github to share with some developer friends, and maybe inspire contribution by anyone who organically finds the project.

With very limited coding knowledge I've made a simple PHP site to start creating placeholders while I figure out how to make it all work.

## Crypto Enthusiast, not expert
I got into crypto in mid 2017. Obviously made some profit and thought it was a good idea to invest with some friends, which I did. Then experienced some major losses during the downturns. 
This was due to:
a. My lack of market knowledge
b. Poor risk management
c. Limited internet access

A dashboard that is accessible by trusted friends and connected to exchange API's, would allow collaborative moniting and management of cryptocurrency investments.

Also, some simple additional functionality (I think simple for the right people) would greatly mitigate risk due to volatility. 
For example, allow an open sell order, with automatic cancel and stop loss placement. Or, immediately re-order at a defined rate or % after fulfilled order.

I'm sharing this project here incase other people have similar ideas and may wish to contribute to the project. 

## Goals
1. Introduce more people to cryptocurrency and opensource projects
2. Allow groups of trusted friends to collaboratively invest in and manage cryptocurrency 
3. Trading Dashboard through exchange API, Share trade decisions, Multi Sig Withdraw
4. Share research about good projects and technologies
5. Identify risks and opportunity in crypto and associated tech
6. Utilise or fork good projects for community development
7. Free opensource code and SAAS
8. Proceedes from subscriptions returned to community development fund

## Project Requirements
I've hacked together some rough PHP to try and lay out what I see and learn how to connect and tune all the functions.

There's a lot needed to make this a working product. I'm not sure what the best wrappers or libraries are, even how to make that decision.

How to fetch and process live market data. - Languages? PHP has been hell for trying to create calculations.

Definition of trade strategies.

Programing trade logic.

Integrate chat into trading platform.

User accounts and permissions - ensure no double control.

Security.

# Even Longer term goals
It may seem cliche, but I'm not in Crypto for the money. 

I'm in it to avail access to land and resources that reduce the requirement for money or monetary instruments.

Also, I believe distributed ledger and blockchain have hug potential to help ensure contribution of effort, intellectual property or other resources is fairly distributed in a way that supports healthy communities.

I propose a property development strategy, starting with group investment in community assets (easier to share) such as educational or event spaces, moving towards co-working and co-living environments.

Contributors can support new technology or projects by supplying essential resources, in return for access or benefits of access to community owned assets.

The concept is for more localised implimentation and development, with feedback and collaboration on a wider scale. It's about getting money out of banks and into land and using that land to house people who create tangible value for the community.
